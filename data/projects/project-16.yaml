    title: "From Machine Learning to Machine Intelligence"
    abstract: "Recent progress in artificial intelligence sparks new interest in an old philosophical question: Can machines think? In this talk I will consider the use of Machine Learning (ML) methods to develop intelligent thinking machines. Two criteria will be considered: behavioral indistinguishability and procedural (or algorithmic) similarity. It seems probable that ML methods will eventuelly yield computers that satisfy the former. But what about the latter? The inner workings of ML-programmed computers such as deep neural networks and reinforcement learning agents may be no easier to understand than those of human cognizers. Thus, I will review empirical methods for addressing this 'Black Box Problem', e.g. experimental techniques and methods of mathematical analysis. I will also consider a priori reasons for thinking that ML-programmed computers will not only become behaviorally indistinguishable from humans, but that they will also exhibit a degree of procedural similarity. Because these computers are nurtured and situated in the real-world environment that is also inhabited by humans, the methods they will acquire in order to engage that environment are likely to mirror our own."
